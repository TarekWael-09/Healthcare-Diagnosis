🏥 Healthcare Diagnosis Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that can predict medical diagnoses based on patient data. It showcases the full pipeline from data preprocessing to evaluation, with a focus on model performance and interpretability for healthcare use cases.

🚀 Project Overview
We developed several classification models to predict a diagnosis based on anonymized patient records. This system is intended to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of conditions, improving both speed and accuracy.

Workflow:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Engineering & Encoding

Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

Evaluation & Confusion Matrix Visualization

Model Comparison and Selection

📊 Dataset
Patient Demographics (Age, Gender, etc.)

Medical Measurements (Blood Pressure, Glucose, BMI, etc.)

Diagnosis Label (Binary or Multiclass)

Note: All personal identifiers have been removed or anonymized for ethical use.

🧠 Models Used
We implemented and compared the following classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Performance was measured using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score


Confusion Matrix

🔍 Example Results
Model	Accuracy	
Logistic Regression	0.34	
Random Forest	0.32	
XGBoost	0.33	

 Logistic Regression showed the best balance between precision and recall and was selected for deployment.
